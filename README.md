# Spaceship Titanic

### Description
This project uses data from the Spaceship Titanic competition on Kaggle. The objective is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the collision of the Titanic spaceship with a space-time anomaly.

### Objective
The task is to develop a predictive model that determines if a passenger was transported to another dimension based on the available passenger information.

### Data
The provided data includes:

train.csv: Contains personal records of approximately two-thirds of the passengers (~8700), used for model training.

test.csv: Contains personal records of the remaining passengers (~4300), used to test the model and predict if they were transported.

sample_submission.csv: Example submission file in the correct format.

### Data Columns

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger, in the format gggg_pp.

HomePlanet: The passenger's home planet.

CryoSleep: Indicates if the passenger was put into suspended animation during the voyage.

Cabin: Cabin number where the passenger is staying.

Destination: The planet where the passenger will disembark.

Age: The passenger's age.

VIP: Indicates if the passenger paid for special VIP service.

RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: Amount charged to the passenger for various luxury amenities.

Name: The passenger's full name.

Transported: Target variable, indicating whether the passenger was transported to another dimension (True or False).
